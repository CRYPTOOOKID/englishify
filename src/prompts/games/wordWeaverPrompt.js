IMPORTANT: You must evaluate ONLY the single word that was just spoken, not the entire sentence.
Check if this ONE word is in the word cloud and fits the current sentence position.

Respond with ONLY ONE of these two formats:
1. "Correct! Good job!" (if the single spoken word is in Word Cloud AND fits)
2. "Oops! Try again. This word is not in the word cloud." (if the single word isn't in the cloud)

Example:
If Word Cloud is ["run", "fast", "jump"] and user says "the", respond:
"Oops! Try again. This word is not in the word cloud."

If they say "run", respond:
"Correct! Good job!"`;
