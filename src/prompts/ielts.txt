**Task:** Evaluate the following written response to an IELTS Writing Task (Task 1 or Task 2, Academic or General Training). Provide a band score (0-9) for each of the four IELTS Writing assessment criteria and an overall band score for the writing task.

**Input:**

* **Task Type:** [Specify: Academic Task 1, General Training Task 1, Task 2 (common to both)]
* **Task Prompt:** [Insert the exact IELTS Writing Task prompt here]
* **Candidate Response:** [Insert the full text of the candidate's written response here]

**Instructions for AI Evaluation:**

Evaluate the Candidate Response based on the following four IELTS Writing criteria. For each criterion, assign a band score from 0 to 9 based on the detailed descriptors provided below. Then, calculate the overall Task band score.

**Scoring Criteria and Descriptors:**

**1. Task Achievement / Task Response (TA/TR) (Weight: 25% of Task 1 Score, 50% of Overall Writing Score due to Task 2 weighting)**

* **Focus:**  Has the candidate fulfilled the task requirements? How accurately, appropriately, and relevantly has the candidate addressed all parts of the prompt?

* **Detailed Descriptors:**

    * **Academic Task 1:**
        * **High Band (7-9):**  Clearly presents a fully developed answer.  Summarizes all the main features, makes relevant comparisons, and may include details.  Data is accurately selected and interpreted.  Overview is clear.  All requirements of the task are fully met.
        * **Mid Band (5-6):**  Presents a relevant response, but may not fully address all aspects of the task.  Attempts to describe main features, but some may be missed or not sufficiently developed.  Comparisons may be unclear or incomplete.  Data selection may be basic or lack detail.  Overview may be present but not fully clear.
        * **Low Band (Below 5):**  Fails to adequately address the task. May present irrelevant information or significantly misinterpret the input data.  May focus on minor details or be descriptive rather than analytical.  Overview may be missing or inaccurate.  May not meet minimum word count. Off-topic responses are penalized.

    * **General Training Task 1:**
        * **High Band (7-9):**  Clearly communicates the purpose of the letter.  All bullet points are addressed effectively and fully.  Tone is consistently appropriate for the specified context and recipient (personal, semi-formal, or formal).  Letter is well-organized and easy to understand.
        * **Mid Band (5-6):**  Communicates the purpose of the letter, but may not fully address all bullet points or some may be underdeveloped.  Tone is generally appropriate but may be inconsistent in places.  Letter is generally organized but may have some lack of clarity.
        * **Low Band (Below 5):**  Fails to clearly communicate the purpose of the letter.  May miss or misunderstand bullet points.  Tone may be inappropriate or inconsistent.  Letter may be poorly organized and difficult to understand. May not meet minimum word count. Off-topic responses are penalized.

    * **Task 2 (Academic & General Training):**
        * **High Band (7-9):**  Presents a fully developed response to the prompt.  Clearly addresses all parts of the task.  Presents a clear position throughout the response in argumentative tasks.  Ideas are well-developed, relevant, and logically supported with examples (which can be from personal experience).  Essay is well-focused and directly answers the question.
        * **Mid Band (5-6):**  Addresses the prompt, but the response may be somewhat underdeveloped or superficial.  May address all parts of the task but not equally well.  Position may be clear but not consistently maintained in argumentative tasks.  Ideas are relevant but may lack sufficient development or support.  Essay is generally focused but may drift slightly off-topic at times.
        * **Low Band (Below 5):**  Fails to adequately address the prompt.  May present irrelevant or tangential ideas.  May not address all parts of the task.  Position may be unclear or inconsistent in argumentative tasks.  Ideas are underdeveloped or lack relevance.  Essay may be poorly focused or off-topic.  May not meet minimum word count. Off-topic responses are penalized.

**2. Coherence and Cohesion (CC) (Weight: 25% of Task 1 Score, 25% of Overall Writing Score)**

* **Focus:** How well is the answer organized and connected?  Logical flow of ideas, paragraphing, and use of cohesive devices (linking words, pronouns, conjunctions).

* **Detailed Descriptors:**
    * **High Band (7-9):**  Logically organizes information and ideas; there is a clear progression throughout the response.  Uses a range of cohesive devices appropriately and accurately.  Paragraphing is logical and effective.  The response is easy to follow and ideas are clearly linked.
    * **Mid Band (5-6):**  Organizes information and ideas coherently, but there may be some inconsistencies in logical flow.  Uses cohesive devices, but there may be some overuse, underuse, or inaccuracy.  Paragraphing is evident, but may not always be logical or effective.  The response is generally understandable, but some connections between ideas may be unclear.
    * **Low Band (Below 5):**  Lacks clear organization and logical progression.  Cohesive devices are used rarely, inaccurately, or inappropriately, making the response difficult to follow.  Paragraphing is inadequate or absent.  The response is disjointed and difficult to understand.

**3. Lexical Resource (LR) (Weight: 25% of Task 1 Score, 25% of Overall Writing Score)**

* **Focus:** Range and accuracy of vocabulary used. Ability to use a variety of words and phrases, including less common vocabulary and paraphrase effectively.

* **Detailed Descriptors:**
    * **High Band (7-9):**  Uses a wide range of vocabulary fluently and flexibly to convey precise meanings.  Skillfully uses less common vocabulary and idiomatic expressions.  Demonstrates sophisticated control of lexical features with only rare minor errors.  Effective use of paraphrase.
    * **Mid Band (5-6):**  Uses an adequate range of vocabulary for the task.  Attempts to use less common vocabulary, but may be some inaccuracies.  Errors in word choice and collocation may be present but do not impede understanding.  Some attempt at paraphrase.
    * **Low Band (Below 5):**  Uses a limited range of vocabulary, which may be repetitive or inappropriate.  Frequent errors in word choice, spelling, and word formation may impede understanding.  Little or no attempt at paraphrase.  Over-reliance on basic vocabulary.  Memorized phrases or misused "complex" words are penalized.

**4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy (GRA) (Weight: 25% of Task 1 Score, 25% of Overall Writing Score)**

* **Focus:** Variety of sentence structures (simple, compound, complex) and grammatical accuracy.

* **Detailed Descriptors:**
    * **High Band (7-9):**  Uses a wide range of grammatical structures flexibly and accurately.  Majority of sentences are error-free.  Only very occasional errors or slips.  Sophisticated control of grammar.
    * **Mid Band (5-6):**  Uses a mix of simple and complex sentence forms.  Grammatical accuracy is generally good, but errors are present and may be noticeable.  Errors do not frequently impede communication.
    * **Low Band (Below 5):**  Uses only a limited range of grammatical structures, primarily simple sentences.  Frequent grammatical errors, which may impede communication.  Errors in basic grammar are common.

**Scoring Calculation:**

1. **Assign Band Scores:**  Based on the descriptors above, assign a band score (0-9) for each of the four criteria: TA/TR, CC, LR, and GRA.

2. **Calculate Task 1 Score (if applicable):** Average the four criterion scores for Task 1.  (TA/TR + CC + LR + GRA) / 4

3. **Calculate Task 2 Score:** Average the four criterion scores for Task 2. (TA/TR + CC + LR + GRA) / 4

4. **Calculate Overall Writing Score:**
    * If evaluating **only Task 1**, the Overall Writing Score is the Task 1 Score.
    * If evaluating **only Task 2**, the Overall Writing Score is the Task 2 Score.
    * If evaluating **both Task 1 and Task 2**, calculate the weighted average: (Task 1 Score + (Task 2 Score * 2)) / 3.  *Note: In a full IELTS Writing test, Task 2 is weighted double.*  For individual task evaluation, this might not be directly applicable unless evaluating a full test simulation.  For evaluating individual tasks in isolation, just output the score for the task evaluated. If you are evaluating Task 2, then that score *is* more heavily weighted in the overall writing score in a real exam.

5. **Rounding:** Round the Overall Writing Score to the nearest half band.  For example, 6.75 rounds up to 7.0, 6.25 rounds down to 6.0, 6.3 rounds to 6.5, 6.8 rounds to 7.0.
